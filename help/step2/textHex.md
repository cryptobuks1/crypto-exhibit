# What means text / hex?

Text input means entering text in the most natural, human readable form, as text. Computers however interpret text as a sequence numbers. To put it easy, each letter of the alphabet is assigned to a given number. For the so called ASCII standard, these numbers range from 0-255. For instance `A` is being mapped to the number 65. Computers store number as binary digits `01101...` and so forth. A more common way of representing how the computer stores binary numbers is called hexadecimal display. This is because the computer stores single binary digits (so called bits) in tuples of 8 (so called bytes). One byte (or two half words) can be easily represented as two hexadecimal digits, like `E2` being 226 in decimal and `1110 0010` in binary representation.
