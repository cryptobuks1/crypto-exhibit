# What does it mean to encrypt or decrypt?

Comparing cryptography to a lock, encryption is the equivalent of securing the lock: To open it again, you'll either have to use the same key, or you will have to use brute force, in order to get in. Decryption on the other hand means to get access to the information again, by using the key.

Applied to data sciences encryption means to transform any given information using a (set of) key(s), into a form of data, which can not be interpreted by someone not owning the key. Decryption is the process of applying the key, in order to return to the original information.
