# How can I decrypt this again?

Mostly it is fine reproducing the same cryptographic parameters in order to decrypt the output value again. In case of asynchronous cryptography other input values may be required for encryption, than for decryption. In case of a hash function, there is no possible way of reversing to the original input.
