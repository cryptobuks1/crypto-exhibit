# What key size is considered secure?

Depending on the cryptographic algorithm key sizes may vary. However keys need to be a certain size, just to prevent one very common attack, which can be performed on essentially any cryptographic algorithm: brute force. A brute force attack means literally trying each and every possible combination of keys and parameters. Choosing a key of a large enough size, is a very good countermeasure for this attack. Choosing a key size of *just* 128 bit, means an excess of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible combinations. However modern day computer and algorithms trying to break properties of given cryptographic algorithms might allow to not test every possible combination and thus make the algorithm vulnerable. This is why in modern day cryptographic applications key sizes of 1,024 bits and up (2,048, 4,096, ...) are most commonly referred of being **secure**.
